# bootstrap-portfolio

This Bootstrap Portfolio showcases my recently aquired skills in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It also provides details of some of my projects and achievements to date. 

## Description

My page shows how I can utilise the following bootstrap elements; navbar, jumbotron, grid containing cards, heading sections, links and finally a footer. To implement this the basis of my code is taken from bootstrap. 

Please find a screenshot below of the initial landing area.

I used CSS and some further HTML classes to customise my webpage. 

It aims to show you my current skills in building and customising a webpage using Bootstrap and CSS, whilst implementing the requirements of the Module 03 Challenge in the EdX Frontend Web Development Bootcamp. 

My biggest challenge was formatting this page in order to give it the uniform spacing and borders I desired. I feel that I have almost achieved this as I would have liked. I achieved the current spacing and uniform margins by using nested containers. I also struggled to format the image in the jumbotron as I would have liked, hence the media query for this. 

## Usage

Please use the links or scroll to navigate the sections of the page and to judge whether my implemetation of all the required elements has been achieved. I have tried to ensure that all the links are functional and navigate to the correct areas of the webpage or other webpages. The page should loosely mimic my original portfolio, found by clicking the links on the 2nd card in the 'Work' section entitled 'Portfolio Project'.

## References

I have used the bootstrap code for the elements on my page. 
Styling the elements has been some trial and error, but I have used the following sources too; ask BCS, Stack Overflow and Get Bootstrap. I also used the 'Ask the Class' channel in slack to discuss issues I was having in GitHub. I have watched a series of videos in youtube about bootstrap too. These can be found at 'Net Ninja' in youtube. 


## Contributing

I would very much appreciate some feedback on the methods I have used to achieve the task. Is this the most concise code I could have used? I would also like to know if the readme layout and content was appropriate for the task if possible please.
